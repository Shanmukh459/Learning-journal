# Learning Journal

- This is a solo project that I worked on to develop a template for mobile first design
- In this project, I tried to create a basic layout for a Learning Journal application
- As I mentioned before, to develop this app I followed a mobile first design approach
- So the screen has two different stylings one for each mobile and desktop resolution
- I have used media queries to adjust the styling to fit to the desired screen
- I have stretched my skills in implementing a hamburger sudebar for mobile version.
- This hamburger menu disappears in widescreen view displaying the list of sidebar menu items in a row
- Also worked with CSS grid to arrange the cards responsively
